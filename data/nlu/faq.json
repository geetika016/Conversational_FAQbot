This page will help stakeholders find the information they need to adopt and continue to use the My CFIA system successfully, with limited support.  If stakeholders are unable to find the information they are looking for on export certification available in DSDP, they should then call 1-800-442-2342 between the hours of 7a.m and 7p.m EST. Trained, first-contact phone agents in Service Canada and the National Service Centre, will help them with MyCFIA Support questions (including enrolment) and resolving issues encountered (error screens) through the export application process. If the agents are unable to assist, the enquiry will be triaged as per the established enquiries’ triage process (RDIMS 11883040).   While the service is being digitized, Area staff will still be responsible for answering export questions for commodities not yet available in DSDP, on complex issues linked to an application in progress, active export shipments and Regulatory enquiries (plant and animal).   Additional information on responding to industry questions about My CFIA can be found on the DSDP Merlin page.",

Export – automated export certification process which allow exporters to apply online for certificates and monitor the status of their applications. Information explaining all export requirements are available online for exporters to refer to when they are filling out their application forms.    Inspection – Inspectors input inspection notes and other objective evidence and upload inspection data — including documents, images, and videos — directly into the DSDP.

Industry will be able to submit service requests, pay for and receive certificates electronically through the My CFIA portal, which can be accessed 24/7 to track, manage, copy, and reuse application requests; in addition, industry can access all previously issued certificates.
